# E-Commerce Conversion Funnel Analysis
E-Commerce Conversion Funnel Analytics focuses on tracking how users move from visiting a website to completing a purchase. It helps identify where customers drop off in stages like product view, add to cart, and checkout. The insights support better user experience, marketing optimization, and improved sales performance.

An online shopping website is getting a lot of visitors, but very few people actually buy something.
The company doesn’t know where customers are getting stuck or why they leave before buying.
Because they can't see what users are doing at each step, they lose money but don’t know the reason.
